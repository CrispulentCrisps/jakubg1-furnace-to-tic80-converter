# Context

The converter was intially created due to difficulties with working the TIC-80 tracker in an effective manner, so this was done for an easier time working the music.

The work was done for a TIC-80 conversion of the game Chain Blast, a game jam game created by Jakubg1 with the game and myself for the music. [https://jakubg1.itch.io/chain-blast-demo] link here [https://github.com/jakubg1/ChainBlast] github link as well.

# Use

For this you will need Furnace and use a system with at max 4 channels, Wonderswan is a good example of that.

Music data converted will be output as music_data.txt and will store all the musical data from the music.

Wavetables will need to be recreated by the coder to sound the same as the composer intended.

Samples cannot be used for this converter, even if systems like the wonderswan support it.

Musicians should keep in mind that at max 16 wavetables can be used per song.

Patterns must be 128 rows long
